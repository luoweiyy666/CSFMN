*An overview of the proposed CSFMN. CSFMN first transforms the input LR image into the feature space using a convolutional layer, performs feature extraction using a series of residual hybrid feature groups (RHFGs), and then reconstructs these extracted features by an upsampler module. The RHFG block is mainly implemented by a feature fusion module (FFM) layer, convolution layer and residual connection. The FFM block is mainly implemented by a channel-spatial fusion modulation (CSFM) layer and a convolutional channel mixer (CCM).*
